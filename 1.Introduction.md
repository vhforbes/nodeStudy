## Introduction to server side: 

A server side website can display tailored information to the user. Enables to save user information, like credit cards and preferences, providing a better experience.

Allow interactions, like email notifications and updates.

### Static sites:

The HTTP response retrieves always the same information. So all the users will recive the same HTML CSS and JS files.

### Dynamic sites

Content is dynamically generated. Data is inserted in the HTMl via placeholders in templates. It can return diferent data for a URL depending on the information provided or stored.

The code that suport that type of dynicamic data is known as **server-side-programming**

## Client-Server Overview

### Web servers and HTTP

HTTP is how the browsers communicate with web servers. HTTP requests.

A request includes:

- A URL identifying a target server and resource.

- A method that defines the action:
  - GET: Gets a resource
  - POST: Create a resource
  - HEAD: Gets the metadata without the body (like GET would do). I can be used to know the last time when the resource was updated and only use GET ("more expensive"), if it has changed.
  - PUT: updates a resource
  - DELETE: deleles a resource

- Information can be encoded with the request. In a GET it can be in the URL like: **http://mysite.com?name=Fred&age=11** 

- POST data, more secure as it don't shows in the URL. Encoded within the request body.

- Client-side cookies. Session data about the client so the server can use to determine their login status and permissions.
